<h1>C++ Project - Log Management and Analysis Tool</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
This project is a software tool developed as part of the C++ course at INSA Lyon, focused on log management and analysis. The tool is designed to process and analyze log files, providing insights and visual representations of the data. The project includes a C++ implementation that handles log parsing, data management, and graphical visualization of the results.

<h2>Features</h2>

- <b>Log Parsing</b>: Efficiently parses log files, extracting relevant information for further processing.
- <b>Data Management</b>: Manages log data using custom data structures, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval.
- <b>Graphical Visualization</b>: Generates visual representations of log data, helping users to identify patterns and trends.
- <b>Modular Design</b>: The project is designed with modular components, separating concerns like log management, data processing, and visualization.

<h2>Project Structure</h2>

- <b>Source Code</b>: The main C++ source code for the application.
  - `Analog.cpp`: Core logic for handling log analysis.
  - `Gestion_Log.cpp`: Manages log file operations and data extraction.
  - `Graph.cpp`: Handles the graphical representation of data.
  - `Log_Fonctions.cpp`: Utility functions for log operations.
  - `Main.cpp`: Entry point of the application.
